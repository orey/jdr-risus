# Risus extensions archive

## All Risus Extensions

The aim of this part of the repo is to archive a lot of Risus extensions, settings and scenarios that were developed by the community and that are quite difficult to gather.

I may have the time to sort it out by sections and even to repackage it in something usable (some captures done on [archive.org](http://archive.org) are not so readable because the font is very clear). The objective is to release a PDF once in a while with all the known extensions of Risus, most of them being lost in the depths of the Web.

Versions:

* [20240526 All Risus Extensions v01.pdf](20240526 All Risus Extensions v01.pdf)

## All Risus solo extensions

Look at the `Solo` folder to have the same approach for solo settings and adventure.

## Some links to continue exploring

Most of the following links were already explored but I keep them just in case to have a second look if, one day, I have time. They were aggregated by Guy Hoyle, one of the big contributors of the Risus community.

### Risus Pages - Gone But Not Forgotten

**The following is a list of Risus links )from the Cumberland Risus links list and other places) that are no longer online. However, they ARE still accessible thanks to the magic of the Wayback Machine ([http://www.archive.org/web/web.php](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php)). The links below are linked to the archived versions of these websites. If you find a link that should not be on this list, please let me know via the Risus Talk mailing list on Yahoo Groups (Risustalk-owner at yahoogroups.com).
